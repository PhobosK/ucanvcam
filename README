ucanvcam is (C) 2007, 2008 Paul Fitzpatrick (paulfitz@alum.mit.edu)
It is free software, under the GPLv2, see GPL.TXT

ucanvcam has numerous dependencies and integrated code, see DEPENDENCIES.TXT

Certain effects from the EffecTV project are included, under the GPL.
I'd like to acknowledge that project as an inspiration for ucanvcam.
Basically, one day I wanted to be able to do EffecTV effects over
skype, and ucanvcam grew out of that.

ucanvcam currently can build in one of the following configurations:

  standalone program on linux, optionally providing output via vloopback
  kernel module.

  standalone program on windows

  activex object on windows

To use with the current skype beta (version 2.0.0.43) on linux, you'll need 
the "gstfakevideo" workaround (do a web search).

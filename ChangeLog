2008-06-16  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/native_effects/PicmixEffect.cpp: give a default example.

	* src/native_effects/TickerEffect.cpp: make font configurable.

2008-06-14  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* conf/PackageInfo.cmake: bump version to 0.1.5

	* src/native_effects/ImageLoader.cpp: fixed bug where image
	file was not being opened in binary mode (trouble on windows)

2008-06-06  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/native_effects/PicmixEffect.cpp: accept "effect.ini"
	if "config.ini" is not present, to be compatible with
	downloaded effects.

2008-06-04  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/native_effects/PicmixEffect.cpp: fix configuration file
	reading.

2008-05-28  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/doc/linux_tips.dox: add some linux help.

	* src/doc/windows_tips.dox: add some windows help.

	* src/native_effects/PicmixEffect.cpp: fix aspect ratio,
	improve compatibility with existing picmix config files.

2008-05-26  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/native_effects/PicmixEffect.cpp: first crude but working
	effort at using picmix caches for effects.  Tried it with the
	flag (http://makesweet.com/mixer/my-flag) effect and it worked.
	No shading, or surface selection, and rather slow so far.

	* src/native_effects/ImageLoader.h: add image sequence cache.

	* src/native_effects/MapCache.h: add key for interpreting
	picmix maps.

	* src/native_effects/OverlayEffect.cpp: move simple overlay
	operation to a dedicated effect, reserve picmix for specialized
	remapping behavior.

	* src/native_effects/PicmixEffect.cpp: for now, just
	use this effect to overlay a graphic with transparency
	on the video stream.

2008-05-25  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/native_effects/PicmixEffect.cpp: stub now reads 
	configuration, and single image overlays.   Still just a
	stub though.

2008-05-24  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/native_effects/PicmixEffect.cpp: add stub for a new
	effect.

2008-05-23  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/linux/VcamLinux.cpp: video capture disabled for now,
	while compiling to distribute with a codec-stripped version
	of the ffmpeg libraries.


2008-05-22  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/gui/gui.cpp: deal with string issues in version 2.6
	of wxwidgets

	* src/modules/CMakeLists.txt: inaccurate path if YARP 
	compiled with an out-of-source build.

2008-04-19  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* conf/PackageInfo.cmake: factor out packaging verbiage.

2008-04-18  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/gui/cmdline.cpp: give help message when called with no
	arguments, rather than running with defaults (which are not
	usually very interesting).

	* src/common/location.cpp: rudimentary logic for finding media
	files when ucanvcam is downloaded as a binary package for Linux.

	* src/gui/gui.cpp: label inputs, outputs, effects

	* src/win32/VcamWin.cpp: fix up possible deadlock

	* src/win32/ShmemImage.h: factor out image-over-shmem
	logic.

2008-04-15  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/modules/CMakeLists.txt: explicitly list the
	ffmpeg driver in YARP - needed on Linux for video4linux or
	firewire access.

2008-04-14  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/gui/cmdline.cpp: begin a command-line version of
	ucanvcam, for use without a GUI.

	* configure: add dummy configure script that calls cmake.

	* src/common/Effect.h: (and many other files) made class
	names and filenames less obscure.

2008-04-12  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* CMakeLists.txt: improved NSIS packaging, version bump.

2008-04-10  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* CMakeLists.txt: version bump, windows build actually works
	well for the first time; assumes 320x240 RGB at the moment 
	though...

	* src/win32/VcamWin.cpp: mutex for access to input device.

	* wrapper/win32/ShmemBus.h: start using shmem on windows to
	decouple image acquisition and processing from activex voodoo.

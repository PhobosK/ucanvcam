Operation of ucanvcam is quite simple once installed on Windows.
You should see an extra camera input called something like
"ucanvcam virtual camera" or similar.  This input will initially
be a still blue image.  It should come to life when you run ucanvcam
(start -> ucanvcam), and select an input and an output.
The input to ucanvcam should typically be a real camera, and the 
output is "ucanvcam virtual camera" or similar name.

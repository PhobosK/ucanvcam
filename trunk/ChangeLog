	* CMakeLists.txt: version bump, windows build actually works
	well for the first time; assumes 320x240 RGB at the moment 
	though...

	* src/win32/VcamWin.cpp: mutex for access to input device.

	* wrapper/win32/ShmemBus.h: start using shmem on windows to
	decouple image acquisition and processing from activex voodoo.

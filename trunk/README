ucanvcam is (C) 2007, 2008 Paul Fitzpatrick (paulfitz@alum.mit.edu)
It is free software, under the GPLv2, see GPL.TXT

ucanvcam depends on the following free libraries:
  gd, freetype, SDL, YARP, wxwidgets
See DEPENDENCIES.TXT for details

Certain effects from the EffecTV project are included, under the GPL.

ucanvcam currently builds on linux and windows.

To use with the current skype beta (version 2.0.0.43) on linux, you'll need 
the "gstfakevideo" workaround (do a web search).

Compile with cmake.  Glitch: you currently have to run cmake twice, it
may fail the first time.

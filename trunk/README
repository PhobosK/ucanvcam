ucanvcam is (C) 2007 Paul Fitzpatrick (paulfitz@alum.mit.edu)
It is free software, under the GPLv2, see GPL.TXT

Sweetcam has numerous dependencies and integrated code, see DEPENDENCIES.TXT

Certain effects from the EffecTV project are included, under the GPL.
I'd like to acknowledge that project as an inspiration for ucanvcam.
Basically, one day I wanted to be able to do EffecTV effects over
skype, and ucanvcam grew out of that.

ucanvcam currently can build in one of the following four configurations:

  service using vloopback module on linux
  activex object on windows
  standalone program on linux
  standalone program on windows
